# SEIR-modeling
The SAS-ETS-COVID-19-SEIR-model.pdf document describes the SEIR epidimiologic model and how it can be applied to some existing data sets using SAS/ETS software.

The SAS code described in this document and associated data sets are available in the following files:
* jhuus.sas7bdat : SAS data set  based on Johns Hopkins data for US cases by state
* jhuworld.sas7bdat : SAS data set  based on Johns Hopkins data for World cases by country and province
* simseir.sas :  sample SEIR simulation code 
* estseir.sas : sample SEIR estimation code
* intervene.sas : sample SEIR with intervention estimation code
* forecast.sas : sample SEIR with intervention simulation code
